<h1>This project is a client-server<\h1> 

application developed using Qt and TCP sockets to facilitate real-time communication. 
The server is designed to handle multiple client connections concurrently, ensuring efficient and seamless interaction. 
On the client side, a sleek graphical user interface (GUI) built with Qt enhances user experience and simplifies interaction with the server.

Key features include:

Multitasking Server: The server can manage multiple client connections simultaneously, allowing for smooth communication without delays or bottlenecks.

Intuitive Client GUI: Clients can interact with the server through an intuitive GUI developed using Qt, making the communication process straightforward and user-friendly.

Real-Time Data Exchange: Clients can connect to the server and engage in real-time data exchange, enabling seamless communication and collaboration.

JSON Serialization: All data exchanged between the client and server is serialized using JSON format, ensuring compatibility, efficiency, and ease of parsing.
